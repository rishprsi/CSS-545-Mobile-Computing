1. Intended platform for development is: iOS.
    As all my current devices are in the Apple ecosystem. It would be most convenient for me to develop and debug iOS apps.
2. Intended framework/programming language: Swift.
    As swift is the native development language for iOS.
3. Exploring cross-platform development: No/Very Hard Maybe.
    I have read and explored that debugging is really painful on cross-platform frameworks like React Native/Flutter.
    If I find that not to be true, I can change my decision to React Native (as I am very comfortable with JS) or Flutter (Fast growing and popular).
